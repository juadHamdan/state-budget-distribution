An employee who earns 15,000 NIS a month with a bachelor's degree (with 3.25 tax credits)
will pay 470 NIS a month for security and public order, 
215 NIS per year for the Prime Minister's Office, 
107 NIS per year for Aliyah and Integration, 
Only 2 NIS (!) a month for environmental protection 
and 1878 NIS per year for transportation.

So I didn't take out a calculator and wasted a few hours on the Knesset website to understand the distribution of the employee's taxes â€“ I just used the website I had been working on for the past few days.

If you want to gain insights and be aware of where everyone's money is going - go to https://lnkd.in/dcVZfCvk and try it for yourself.

How does the site work? 
Enter your monthly salary and income tax credits, and you receive a breakdown (monthly/yearly) in NIS regarding the distribution of taxes you pay.

The data is taken from the Knesset website and the "Budget Key" website.
